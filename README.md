# Custom Spotify API Interface & Projects

A monorepo for the custom interface I made for the Spotify web api and the various projects and scripts that leverage it

<br>

## Summary
 - Created custom interface for the spotify API that provides a simplified, easy to use library for leveraging various functionality of the spotify API.
   - Various python libraries and packages already exist for the spotify API, but after using them for a few months, I knew I wanted to make my own
   - Reasons for making my own DIY spotify library:
     - The existing libraries felt too bloated
     - Designing and implementing a custom interface from scratch would allow for me to shape it and customize it to fit my needs and use cases
     - I wanted to have my own way of handling authentication for the Spotify web API  
   - The "Spotify Jukebox" project is a working concept of a web-app that will act as simplified Spotify app, centered around sharing a common queue of music, the "jukebox", if you will, so that 2 or more users can act as DJ
     - A proof of concept of the jukebox queue has been implemented in the form of a simple CLI
     - The next step will be to build an API to handle the basic functions of the juxebox and then build a web-app as a front end that leverages this API
